## 📘 Project Description

**HireFi** is a smart contract-based platform that enables trustless agreements between freelancers and clients.  
By leveraging blockchain technology, HireFi ensures transparent, secure, and automatic payments without intermediaries.

Whether you're hiring a developer, a designer, or a consultant, **HireFi** makes freelancing safer and smarter.

## 💡 What It Does

HireFi creates a decentralized escrow system between freelancers and clients:

1. **Clients** can post jobs and deposit funds into a smart contract.  
2. **Freelancers** can accept jobs, complete them, and request payment release.  
3. **Smart Contracts** automatically release funds when both parties confirm completion.  

This eliminates disputes, reduces fraud, and creates a transparent workflow for all users.
